    <h3>Welcome:</h3>
    <p>
      Cover crops can provide nitrogen (N) to the following cash crops by scavenging N in the soil or, in the case of legumes, by fixing N from the atmosphere.
      However, some cover crops can reduce the available N to following cash crops by immobilization.
      It can be difficult to know how much available N a cover crop will provide or if it will immobilize N.
      The amount of available N depends on the amount of biomass and the cover crop quality as well as soil temperature and moisture conditions.
      This calculator was developed to help provide guidance for N management when using cover crops.
    </p>

    <h3>What to Expect from the Nitrogen Calculator:</h3>
    <p>
      This calculator will predict how much and when nitrogen will be available from aboveground cover crop biomass.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the calculator gives you a <strong>positive number</strong>, this is a <strong>N credit</strong>, which can be subtracted from your target N fertilizer rate.</li>
      <li>If the calculator gives you a <strong>negative number</strong>, this is a <strong>N debit</strong>, and you should add additional N fertilizer at planting to account for the N immobilized by the cover crop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You will need to have measured <strong>cover crop biomass</strong> in your field and have an <strong>analysis of the cover crop</strong> nitrogen, carbohydrates, cellulose and lignin to use this calculator.
